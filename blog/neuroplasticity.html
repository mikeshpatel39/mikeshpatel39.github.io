      <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
      <div class ="blog">
        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding neuroplasticity can help us not be as attached or hung up on our self-perceptions and identities, a crucial factor in being able to learn, as learning requires us to shed previous ways of thinking that often hold up our self-concept in favour of new ones.
          Understanding that our brains are very malleable and adaptable to our conditions, contrary to popular beliefs especially in the recent past, allows us to go ahead and create the conditions for change to happen, and crucially, to allow it.
          <br><br>

          Using some of the core principles of neuroplasticity, such as neurons that fire together, wire together, lends itself to an active mode of learning where practice and 'muscle memory' can become embedded in our brains. This means allowing time to practice rather than just
          trying to understand things intellectually. Using neuroplasticity means also not believing that 'I am not the kind of person to be a programmer' or 'my brain doesn't work that way' and giving more emphasis on the fluidity of our abilities and identities.
          <br><br>
          Taking on new challenges, as well as keeping healthy and having a broad experience in day to day life helps keep the brain plastic and amenable to learning. Meditation and exercise also have been proven to increase neuroplasticity. 
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944261/">This article</a> on 'Neuroplasticity and Buddhism' I found particularly interesting, and illustrates this point.
        </p>
        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          Growth mindset, as opposed to fixed mindset, believes that abilities are not fixed, that they can and do change over time. This is relevant because a fixed mindset is likely to not be very resilient in the face of failure, and resist learning or even
          attempting because a challenge appears outside of current abilities. 
          <br><br>
          While this seems like a somewhat arbitrary point, the impact can be impressive. The stories cited by Carol Dweick on the difference measured in outcomes for students after learning and absorbing this is very impressive and testament to what can happen when
          negative self-talk is ceased. It is a good reminder to me throughout this journey in programming to not fall prey to self-talk saying that my logical abilities or other abilities are fixed and therefore learning how to program is outside of my capabilities.
          Instead, I will believe I can grow into it. While generally I have this attitude already, no doubt there will be and have been times when self-doubt is stronger than others. Remembering this when times get tough is how I will integrate Growth Mindset into my 
          learning journey. I enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWn_TJTrnU">this video</a> on Growth Mindset. 
        </p>
        <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
        <p>
          One aspect that is relevant to my learning plan that jumps out straightaway is something that was mentioned by Joseph in the video for the sprint which mentions Growth Mindset doesn't just apply to how you consider your own abilities,
          but also to how you consider that of others. And when we get to bootcamp, where we will be working on projects with other people, not only believing that I can rise to challenges but also others will be key to not losing patience with others.
          Probably also a large aspect to my procrastination habits is a protection from failure. Having a growth mindset, especially looking back at how far already I have come as evidence of this ability to change and grow, will be important to
          overcome unnecessary procrastination and perfectionism. I will shed unhelpful beliefs like 'I am not the most logical person' that will stand in the way of me attempting to learn and grow.
