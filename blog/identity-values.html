        <h1>Identity and Values</h1>
        <div class ="blog">
          <p>If I had to define “my values” they would be things like freedom, equality, fairness, authenticity, integrity and peace.<br><br> 

            I suppose a complex example of a ethical choice that I still reassess every now and then is going vegan in 2015. I was weighing up what I believed was fairness for animals and the climate, authenticity in lifestyle (the ‘purity’ of plant based food over the heaviness of meat) and integrity of eating meat but not being involved in the killing of them against freedom to eat anything and the freedom (as I thought before informing myself) to have a robust and functioning body. Once I had been convinced that it would not sacrifice the second cost, it became much easier to make this choice based on the otherwise inconsistent choices I was making every day not in line with my other values. Since then, though, I have perhaps leaned a bit more into the freedom again to strike a balance, not making a fuss when offered food by accepting whatever is given to me, and occasionally eating meat or other foods when I feel like it, while maintaining a generally vegan/vegetarian diet. The consequence of these decisions has been positive, aligning me closer to my values while hopefully making a small contribution to carbon emissions and saving animals’ lives. <br><br>
            
            My culture like most has a strong sub-strand of justice that I have tapped into, though more often than not it has been turned against unjust aspects of that said culture. I am lucky in a sense that while I have a strong connection to my culture mainly through my mother, I have grown up in various countries and therefore can see somewhat objectively the pros and cons of the various cultures. Nonetheless, aspects of my culture that I have consciously picked up (communitarian / social values as opposed to individualism, and spirituality over materialism) have become strong aspects on which I hinge my values and identity. Experiencing racism in the white majority countries I have mainly lived in, and paying due respect to my whakapapa, led me as a teenager to strongly embrace being Indian as part of my identity, along with Buddhism which I picked up slightly later on. As part of that Buddhist journey, however, ironically a lot of it has been about letting go of the concept of the self as having a continuous and independent identity, as well as the idea of any objectivity in the idea of values, besides those that underlie dharma, ie things like compassion, love and no-self.<br><br>
            
            My strengths in terms of learning and career development is my versatility, I have changed fields multiple times and have been quick to pick up most of the things I have chosen. From that, I also have a strength in making connections between disparate ideas and fields, from which a lot of innovation comes forward. I am creative, and a good listener which is helpful in learning and in the career paths I have chosen thus far. I am also independent which can be a strength and weakness. Limitations are often procrastination, starting things and then not finishing them, being OK at many things but not great at anything and perhaps undermining myself by not allowing myself to fully reach potential in any area or show my skills openly to others. These are all things I think I have improved on over time. <br><br>
            
            I believe my passion for improving the world and new ideas can help me with this course as I want to use it for that purpose. However, the flipside of that is that I can become impatient if that seems like a distant prospect, or the work seems unrelated to achieving that immediately. I could become bored with the things I am learning and become attached to something different, not allowing me to get the most out of what I am doing. I am creative which will presumably help with finding solutions, however sometimes my ideas are beyond my capabilities, or I haven’t fully considered the details or implications, meaning I later become disillusioned or waste time on fruitless ideas. <br><br>
            
            I do a lot of work in political groups and often tension comes up to various degrees. I have tried many things: being open in a group setting and trying to initiate change on that level, having private conversations with the people/person involved, waiting for things to resolve themselves and reflecting on myself and attempting to change my own behaviours. All of these (except for waiting things out) have been effective at different times, but rarely on their own. Self-reflection and honesty has always worked and where I have failed has often been when I had not been fully honest and tried to sweep issues under the rug. For this reason, I would (easier said than done) trust my gut and address problems as early as possible.
