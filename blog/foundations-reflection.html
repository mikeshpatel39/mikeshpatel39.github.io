        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
        </h3> 
        <p>
          1. My ego can spend a long time worrying I am behind others and will look like a fool, though perhaps not
          nearly as much as it used to. <br>
          2. I like to think I like a challenge and am very adaptable, but that's possibly because I put myself
          in situations that I can adapt to relatively easily. When it comes to something a bit more outside my 
          comfort zone, like learning how to program, I am finding a surprising amount of defense mechanisms and 
          self-doubt creeping in.<br>
          3. I am more logical than I give myself credit for - I have a self-perception of myself as not good at logic,
          but this seems more self-perception than based on anything real.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Values have a large role to play in the attitude you bring to learning and programming, what you do it for,
          how you approach working with others and whether you are open to learning in the first place as well.<br>
          Empathy is essential for being able to work patiently with others, and to learn from others, so therefore
          essential to both learning and programming. <br>
          Self-awareness is probably most important of all: being able to reflect, be aware of your blind spots, regulate your
          emotions, etc. allow you to program well, and also learn.
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I guess how helpful some of it has been in navigating foundations.
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Trying to get on board with some of the concepts which are maybe a little bit simplistic.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
          Because they are even more important than coding skills and lie underneath them, in life, in a coding career and in learning.
        </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
          Not at all. I am much more used to learning the core type of thing and I always find it very enjoyable, so if anything it was a nice balance an break
          from the coding. Beyond that, of course, it has been helpful to just remind me of some of those things which have helped me get throuogh foundations
          and no doubt will help me in bootcamp even more.
