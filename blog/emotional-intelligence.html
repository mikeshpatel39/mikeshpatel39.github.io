      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <div class ="blog">
        <p>This is Sprint 3's Core Blog on Emotional Intelligence, welcome!<br><br>
        "Emotional Intelligence" is a term that emerged in the corporate performance world to describe emotional and empathetic capabilities as well as emotional regulatory skills, which were consie=dered lacking in measures such as IQ but just as, if not more essential, to success than traditional computational 'intelligences'.
        <br><br>
        Daniel Goleman, who popularised the term in the 90s, accordingly identifies five main components to EQ:<br><br> 
        1) Self-awareness. <br>
        2) Self-regulation.<br>
        3) Motivation. <br>
        4) Empathy. <br>
        5) Social skills.<br><br>

        While both measures, IQ and EQ, suffer the same weaknesses that come by virtue of attempting to place a number value on a range of skills that are somewhat amorphous (and the tests for both are noted to be heavily culturally biased and stacked in favour of the wealthy), the recognition or broadening of the meaning of the word 'intelligence' to include social and emotional skills is a good one. It should be clear to anyone that has worked or lived with other humans how essential it is to be able to communicate well and regulate your own emotions. Without the ability to communicate your findings, and make them relatable to people by employing empathetic intelligences, the most intellectually brilliant solutions can be wasted by being untranslatable to others or unappealing. Needless to say as well most endeavours require a team, which means the ability to work well with others. Without this, it is difficult to accomplish much in most fields. This is why the skills and competencies that fall under "EQ" are essential to everyday life as well as "success" in the workplace or in study settings.
