        <div class ="blog">
          <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            My longterm goal is to use these skills to help groups I'm in (activist/political) with utilising digital tools to make change. I'm not planning to have a career in tech, though I may pick up work here or there, if it works like that at all.
          </p>
          <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
          <p>
            My biggest strengths will be my adaptability and ability to reflect and self-regulate which will hopefully allow me to adjust and learn quickly during bootcamp, and work well with others.
            My limitations will be my focus, even though I am stopping work and trying to pare down other commitments, I still have a lot of other stuff going on. Getting to sleep on time when there's not a lot of
            "downtime" between days will maybe also be a challenge. I note these are different from the limitations I put in my foundations learning plan, which I don't think will be as big of an issue during bootcamp.
          </p> 
          <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
          <p>
            I am noticing, probably completely normally, that my brain only has so much capacity to take in new stuff each day, especially if I'm tired from doing other things. So I'm worried about being able to keep up
            with the work, as some others seem to be more advanced than myself in coding knowledge. Keeping focussed may also be difficult, though the immersive nature of it helps. Getting sick at this time is always a concern.
            Working with others in a high-pressure environment when others aren't pulling their weight, or I can't because of my technical limitations is also something I'm worried about.
          </p>
          <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?          </h3>
          <p>
            I have a tendency to sometimes be a bit impatient with others when working on a project - I hope I can improve on this. I'm not sure what leadership skills will be practiced in bootcamp,
            but that is an area I am keen to develop in. Learning when to ask for help and not feel ashamed about it.
          </p>
          <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
          <p>
            People who are observant and willing to patiently and non-patronisingly step in to help even when I'm not asking as that can be difficult for me. Actually listening to my problems and trying to understand
            from my perspective rather than jump in with their assumptions of what the problem is. 
          </p>
          <h3>What are your expectations of yourself in Bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            I will do my best to ask dumb questions so I don't have gaps in my knowledge, as they come up. And, even more difficult for me, seek help outside of group settings or after the fact. I will try
            not to use my other group work as a way to avoid doing my bootcamp work. I will try and turn up on time every day (this will be a challenge I'm not an early riser). I will try and maintain my 2 hour a day
            meditation practice which really helps me work better with others and learn with a clear head. I will try and bring my whole self to these 9 weeks despite the adversities. <br><br>
          </p>
          <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
          <p><h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3><br>

            My longterm (and shortterm) goal is to help others. In terms of coding, that is using these skills to supplement the work I already do and open up some new opportunities to help assist groups and good causes with these skills.<br><br>
            
            <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3><br>
            
            Strengths - have a degree of resilience when things don't go super well. Am curious and want to learn. Can make connections across things quickly.<br>
            Limitations - procrastinate and can therefore rush things under time pressure. Can prefer using my gut instinct to figure things out which serves me well most of the time, but in this area and sometimes elsewise having a more systematic approach would be helpful.<br><br>
            
            <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3><br>
            
            Greater self-discipline, developing a systematic approach to problem-solving, not getting snappy with people under pressure, working fully cooperatively rather than part-cooperatively and part-competitively.<br><br>
            
            <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br><br>
            
              - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives <br>
              - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
              </h3><br>            
        
            I will do my utmost to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and community representatives. As a meditator for a few years, I believe I have some useful skills to be aware of my own reactions and also have tools to manage those rather than reacting. I am committed to making the most of the course and that means cooperating with everyone. If things do get to me, I will try and talk to people about it or take some time out, go for a walk, meditate, exercise.  <br><br>
            
            <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3><br>

            I will seek help from friends who have done the course, and I will also try and summon the courage to ask my facilitators as well. <br><br>

            <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3><br>
            
            I expect them to be approachable and proactive in checking in on us. I expect them to be encouraging and understanding of issues we will run into. I expect them not to be racist.<br><br>
            
            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3><br>
            Not for bootcamp, but I am working (24 hours/average) during foundations with flexible hours on the whole but there may be one or two more clashes as we go along. I am part of many groups and often having meetings in the evening, but I expect that that can be managed during bootcamp?</p>
