        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <div class ="blog">
          <p><h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3><br>

            My longterm (and shortterm) goal is to help others. In terms of coding, that is using these skills to supplement the work I already do and open up some new opportunities to help assist groups and good causes with these skills.<br><br>
            
            <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3><br>
            
            Strengths - have a degree of resilience when things don't go super well. Am curious and want to learn. Can make connections across things quickly.<br>
            Limitations - procrastinate and can therefore rush things under time pressure. Can prefer using my gut instinct to figure things out which serves me well most of the time, but in this area and sometimes elsewise having a more systematic approach would be helpful.<br><br>
            
            <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3><br>
            
            Greater self-discipline, developing a systematic approach to problem-solving, not getting snappy with people under pressure, working fully cooperatively rather than part-cooperatively and part-competitively.<br><br>
            
            <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br><br>
            
              - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives <br>
              - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
              </h3><br>            
        
            I will do my utmost to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and community representatives. As a meditator for a few years, I believe I have some useful skills to be aware of my own reactions and also have tools to manage those rather than reacting. I am committed to making the most of the course and that means cooperating with everyone. If things do get to me, I will try and talk to people about it or take some time out, go for a walk, meditate, exercise.  <br><br>
            
            <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3><br>

            I will seek help from friends who have done the course, and I will also try and summon the courage to ask my facilitators as well. <br><br>

            <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3><br>
            
            I expect them to be approachable and proactive in checking in on us. I expect them to be encouraging and understanding of issues we will run into. I expect them not to be racist.<br><br>
            
            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3><br>
            Not for bootcamp, but I am working (24 hours/average) during foundations with flexible hours on the whole but there may be one or two more clashes as we go along. I am part of many groups and often having meetings in the evening, but I expect that that can be managed during bootcamp?</p>
