      <div class ="blog">
        <p>
          1. The relatively simple problem I was blocked on for quite some time in the last 
          methods exercise was the one called whereareyou. The job was to write a bit of code that
          gives us the object from a list of objects that has the word 'Scooby' in it. <br><br>

          This seems quite simple, and ultimately it was, but it involved using a new function, 
          find, to sort through the object and find the property. To do that, the hints told me to look
          up the 'find' function which I had never seen or used before. It took googling it a few times
          and seeing a few different examples to see how it might be used in this particular context. None
          of the examples I found exactly matched this problem as often the examples were to find something
          to then immediately transform it, not return the whole object. <br><br>

          I started to panic about not seeing how it could be applied here. But I persisted by calming down
          and breaking the problem down. I didn't fully understand the syntax but I first set up the function
          just to find the property 'Scooby' and consolelogged it out. That seemed to work. <br><br>

          What I couldn't figure out was how to get it to return the whole object that it was part of. I racked
          my brain but started to feel despondent as nothing came to mind. I looked up other peoples' enquiries
          in the tech support channel but people seemed to have trouble with another part of the problem not this. <br><br>

          Eventually, I followed the rubber ducky message by breaking it down and explaining to an imaginary
          friend what I needed to do. A possible answer came into my mind at that point to rather than return 
          the property key to try putting in the function immediately return obj.hiding (looking up the property
          within that key). To my amazement that worked! This is what it looked like: <br><br><img src="../whereareyou.png"><br><br>

          2. Given the amount of time and difficulty I had with that one, I was expecting the following challenge
          deBee to be even more time-consuming and challenging. However, since the first part involved converting the strings
          into an array, something I had learned how to do in the first one, I did that without a hitch. Being more familiar
          with the shorthand notation of functions from the Scooby example above, I was also much more quickly able to 
          understand and utilise the filter method. Nonetheless, I greatly surprised myself by filling in the syntax (which
          didn't match the examples online once more) correctly in the first go and delivering a very elegant solution using !=
          .toLowerCase and join(' ') altogether in a efficient bit of code. It felt great! Even if I still didn't 100% understand 
          the logic, I felt I was a lot closer than in the previous exercise. I learned from that that with practice and a degree
          of faith I would probably intuitively develop an understanding of the logic, like learning any new language.
          This is what it looked like: <br><br><img src="../deBee.png"><br><br>

          3. My confidence with different problem solving techniques
           <ol>
                <li>Pseudocode: I'm starting to feel more confident with doing this having seen lots of examples of typical ways of 
                  writing this too, but I'm still not in the habit of writing it.
                </li>
                <li>Trying something: Very confident with this, even if often I don't know why it works when it does!</li>
                <li>Rubber Ducky: Was sketpical at first, but in sticky situations have started to use this and it works</li>
                <li>Reading Error Messages: Still a bit intimidating, but this is one that I researched a bit more and am a bit more comfortable with it now</li> 
                <li>Console.logging: Very comfortable with this, even if I maybe don't quite do it yet as much as I should</li>
                <li>Googling: Comfortable with this and how to word searches well, but not as confident making sense of the gobbledegook results that come through often</li>
                <li>Asking peers for help: Have done it once but feel a bit reticent</li>
                <li>Asking coaches for help: Quite reticient. I've never been one to ask for help, especially from teachers</li>
                <li>Improving your process with reflection: Pretty confident. I like reflecting and I can see that it helps consolidate the learning.</li>
          
            </ol>
